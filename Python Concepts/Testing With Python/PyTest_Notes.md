# PyTest
## What is it?
Python library for writing tests
## Why Use PyTests?
- Has a simplified testing syntax, provides a higher level abstraction to python's built-in `unittest` module
- Rich assertion introspection, when a test fails it provides a detailed explanation for it
- Fixture system
- Compatability with other testing libraries
- Extensive plugin library

## PyTest Concepts
## 1. Fixtures
- Fixtures are a way to provide context to tests
- This could be in the form of an environment (database configured with known parameters) or as content (sample dataset)
